GW2 Walls
=========

Another script to work with HTML parsing with BeautifulSoup 4.
This script will crawl the Media > Wallpapers and Release pages to find links to wallpapers, catalog them, and then download wallpapers for a selected resolution (and optionally a selected release). Right now, I have the basic class together and some of the methods, but I will be refining and adding an argparse front end for running the file as a script.
